Advanced Widgets for Elementor Page Builder.

== Description ==

This plugin contains two very powerful Elementor widgets: **ACF Form** and **Advanced Posts**.
The goal of the plugin however is a larger collection of advanced widgets for [Elementor Page Builder](https://elementor.com/). Expect more useful goodies to be added to the collection in the near future!

ATTENTION: This plugin **requires Elementor Page Builder**! You will not be able to use the plugin without it.

This plugin contains the following Elementor widgets:

* **ACF Form**: A widget capable of rendering a highly customizable ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) Form anywhere on the frontend.
* **Advanced Posts**: A widget capable of rendering posts as specified by an ACF Repeater field, and rendering them using your custom Elementor template.

Please note that this plugin is in its early stages. If you find a bug or have an idea for an improvement, please let us know in the Support forum. We will be happy to help!
